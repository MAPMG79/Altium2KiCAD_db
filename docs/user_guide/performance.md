# Performance Optimization

This guide covers advanced performance optimization techniques available in the Altium to KiCAD Database Migration Tool. These optimizations are particularly useful when working with large databases or in enterprise environments where migration speed is critical.

## OptimizedMigrationEngine

The `OptimizedMigrationEngine` is a specialized migration engine designed for high-performance database migrations. It implements several optimization techniques:

- Parallel processing for component mapping
- Memory-efficient data handling
- Caching of mapping results
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Database optimization

### Configuration

To enable the optimized migration engine, update your configuration file:

```yaml
migration:
  use_optimized_engine: true
  parallel_processing: true
  enable_caching: true
  cache_directory: ".cache"
  vacuum_database: true
  create_indexes: true
```

### Parallel Processing Framework

The parallel processing framework distributes component mapping operations across multiple CPU cores, significantly reducing processing time for large databases.

```python
# Example of using parallel processing
from migration_tool.core import OptimizedMigrationEngine

config = MigrationConfig(parallel_processing=True, max_workers=8)
engine = OptimizedMigrationEngine(config)
result = engine.migrate_with_optimization(altium_data)
```

Key features of the parallel processing framework:

- Automatic workload distribution
- Progress tracking
- Configurable number of worker processes
- Graceful error handling

### Caching Mechanisms

The caching system stores mapping results to avoid redundant processing when the same components are encountered multiple times.

```yaml
# Cache configuration
migration:
  enable_caching: true
  cache_directory: ".cache"
  cache_expiration: 604800  # 7 days in seconds
  cache_compression: true
```

The caching system provides:

- Persistent storage of mapping results
- Automatic cache invalidation for outdated entries
- Optional compression to reduce disk usage
- Cache statistics for performance analysis

### Memory Management Strategies

The optimized engine implements several memory management strategies:

1. **Streaming Processing**: Components are processed in batches to limit memory usage
2. **Selective Loading**: Only necessary data is loaded into memory
3. **Garbage Collection**: Explicit memory cleanup during processing
4. **Memory Monitoring**: Tracking of memory usage to prevent out-of-memory errors

Example configuration:

```yaml
migration:
  batch_size: 1000  # Process 1000 components at a time
  max_memory_usage: "2GB"  # Limit memory usage
  enable_memory_monitoring: true
```

### Database Optimization Techniques

After migration, the engine can optimize the generated KiCAD database:

1. **Vacuum Operation**: Rebuilds the database to reclaim unused space
2. **Index Creation**: Creates indexes on frequently queried fields
3. **Constraint Optimization**: Adds appropriate constraints for data integrity
4. **Query Optimization**: Analyzes and optimizes common query patterns

```yaml
# Database optimization configuration
migration:
  vacuum_database: true
  create_indexes: true
  optimize_queries: true
```

## Performance Monitoring

The `PerformanceMonitor` class provides detailed metrics on migration performance:

```python
# Example of accessing performance metrics
result = engine.migrate_with_optimization(altium_data)
performance_summary = result['performance_summary']

print(f"Total migration time: {performance_summary['full_migration']} seconds")
print(f"Component mapping time: {performance_summary['component_mapping']} seconds")
```

Available performance metrics include:

- Total migration time
- Time spent in each migration phase
- Component processing rate
- Memory usage statistics
- Cache hit/miss ratio

## Best Practices for Optimal Performance

1. **Enable parallel processing** with an appropriate number of workers (typically matching your CPU core count)
2. **Enable caching** for repeated migrations of similar components
3. **Use appropriate batch sizes** based on your system's memory capacity
4. **Optimize your database** after migration for faster access
5. **Monitor performance metrics** to identify bottlenecks
6. **Pre-process your Altium data** to remove invalid or unnecessary components
7. **Use SSD storage** for cache and database files when possible

## Benchmarking

The tool includes benchmarking capabilities to measure performance across different configurations:

```bash
# Run performance benchmark
python scripts/performance_benchmark.py --config benchmark_config.yaml
```

The benchmark will test various configurations and provide recommendations for your specific environment.

## Enterprise Scaling

For enterprise environments with very large databases, consider:

1. **Distributed processing** across multiple machines
2. **Database sharding** for parallel migration of different tables
3. **Incremental migration** to process changes only
4. **Cloud-based processing** for on-demand scaling
