# Altium2KiCAD Database Migration Tool - Documentation Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of documentation from the original monolithic `Altium2KiCAD_db.md` file to a structured documentation system. The migration was completed successfully, with all content properly organized into a logical and navigable documentation structure.

## Migration Process

The migration followed the plan outlined in `DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_MAP.md`, which divided the content of the original 8,820-line file into logical sections and mapped them to appropriate documentation files.

### Key Migration Steps:

1. **Content Analysis**: The original file was analyzed to identify logical sections and content types.
2. **Structure Planning**: A documentation structure was designed following best practices for technical documentation.
3. **Content Migration**: Content was migrated to appropriate files in the new structure.
4. **Cross-Reference Updates**: Links and references between documents were updated to maintain navigability.
5. **Validation**: The migrated documentation was validated for completeness and accuracy.
